              <p>The word Trains means transferring passengers or goods from one place
                  to another place. The history of rail transport began in 6th century BC in Ancient Greece.
                  Evidence indicates that there was 6 to 8.5 km long Diolkos paved trackway, which transported boats across the Isthmus of Corinth in Greece from around 600 BC. Wheeled vehicles pulled by men and animals ran in grooves in limestone, which provided the track element, preventing the wagons from leaving the intended route. The Diolkos was in use for over 650 years, until at least the 1st century AD.Paved trackways were also later built in Roman Egypt.
